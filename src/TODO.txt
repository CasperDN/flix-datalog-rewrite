In project: optimize `bot` out

Add functional and constant handling to join-optimizer.

Does Model in Datalog.flix need to use RelSym? Why not just the PredSym?

Join Optimizer:
How should functional be handled?
Simple: For every input they are called with, record it. The estimated size of a join is 
then the average size the seen values. Like everything else, this relies somewhat on a 
uniformity assumption which is likely to not be true in practice, but it is better than 
nothing. Join algorithm should be Selinger's algorithm. Cost computed as on page 12.
Important note: When joining with a functional the cost is infinity if one of inputs
have yet to be computed. In practice return a None or something like that to avoid errors
leading to choosing an unsound join order.
